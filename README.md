# Car-Price-Prediction
This Car Price Prediction project leverages machine learning to estimate the selling price of used cars based on various characteristics provided in the dataset. It aims to streamline and enhance the process of vehicle evaluation, helping users make informed decisions when buying or selling cars.

## Key Technologies

**Programming Language:**  
- Python

**Libraries & Frameworks:**  
- `pandas` &ndash; Data handling and preprocessing  
- `scikit-learn` &ndash; Machine learning and model building  
- `XGBoost` &ndash; Advanced ensemble regression model  
- `Jupyter Notebook` &ndash; Interactive analysis, prototyping

**Models Utilized:**  
- Linear Regression (`LR`)  
- Random Forest (`RF`)  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (`GBR`)  
- XGBoost Regressor (`XG`)

- **GUI Technology:**  
A user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) is implemented, allowing easy input of car details and instant visualization of predicted prices.
